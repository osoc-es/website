			"p1": "Due to the situation that is being experienced around the world by the Coronavirus crisis, Open Summer of Code 2020 Special Edition pose to students a series of challenges associated with the 'Day After': What will happen when people can go out again from their houses? What have we learned and how should we take it into account and apply them to our day to day (pollution, climate change...)?, what should our problems be from now on: science or soccer?",
			"p2": "At Open Summer of Code we believe and are committed to digital innovation with social impact, we are changers of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 agenda is promoting acceleration towards a better world that must change now. That is why we propose 3 projects (challenges) with this approach in which students can participate and collaborate guided by a mentor:"

				"title": "HIGH QUALITY OPEN DATA IN MADRID",
				"description": "This project proposes the implementation of a system to analyze and validate the quality of geographic data in CSV of the Madrid open data portal. It will make use of semantic technologies (SPARQL for queries, CSV on the Web for metadata) and is expected to be implemented in Python. The tool will be accompanied by a simple web application to facilitate its use by the end user."

				"title": "LATERALITY",
				"description": "Laterality is a disorder in which children do not have a defined dominant side in the brain, which produces a series of difficulties in learning from reading problems to pronunciation problems. \n This project proposes to build a mobile application to help, through a series of exercises, children with difficulties in the pronunciation of the trabadas. Trabadas are those words that contain syllables with two consonants followed by a vowel. The application will have a series of levels through which the student will go through."

				"title": "HIRE A SENIOR",
				"description": "Growing older should not be an obstacle when it’s time to perform an activity that you like, allows you to remain active and with which you feel fulfilled. The idea of this project is to develop an app focused on hiring retired people who are interested, so that they can continue to perform useful tasks and remain mentally active, and at the same time get an additional contribution to their pension. In addition, this will allow those interested in hiring, to have people with great experience in their staff."

			"a3": "#oSoc21 is a summer school where you can test your skills. It’s thought for students with different backgrounds to participate in the same project, interchanging experience and knowledge, applying it to the challenge we have designed this year.",

			"q8": "Can I contact #oSoc21 if I have more doubts? ",
			"a8": "Yes. Use our e-mail address osocspain@gmail.com whenever you have something to ask. Don’t think twice!",
			"q9": "Which are the most relevant changes regarding previous editions? ",
			"a9": "We’ve designed a challenge that will be core idea of every project developed during #oSoc21. Initially, each participant chooses a proposal. Then, we’ll have a brainstorming stage to define more details of each project. The final day of the programme we’ll celebratethe Demo Day to expose the results of our projects. ",
			"q10": "How long is #oSoc21?",
			"a10": "This year’s edition will exceptionally be two weeks long: from the 5th to the 16th of July.",

			"a11": "Considering the exceptional situation brought by the Covid-19 crisis, we don’t have funding companies behind our projects, so the participation is voluntary. "
