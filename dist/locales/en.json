			"p1": "Due to the situation that is being experienced around the world by the Coronavirus crisis, Open Summer of Code 2020 Special Edition pose to students a series of challenges associated with the 'Day After': What will happen when people can go out again from their houses? What have we learned and how should we take it into account and apply them to our day to day (pollution, climate change...)?, what should our problems be from now on: science or soccer?",
			"p2": "At Open Summer of Code we believe and are committed to digital innovation with social impact, we are changers of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 agenda is promoting acceleration towards a better world that must change now. That is why we propose 3 projects (challenges) with this approach in which students can participate and collaborate guided by a mentor:"
